1. Users can enter a lottery with ETH based on a USD fee
2. An admin will choose when th elottery is over.
3. The lottery will select a random winner.

NOTE: This is NOT truely decentralized as we have an admin choosing when the lottery is over.  HOWEVER we could scale it by having a DAO taking over this part OR prehaps creating a code that will selecta winner by random based on a weekly/monthly interval.

How do we test this?

1. `mainnet-fork`
2. `development` with mocks
3. `testnet`
